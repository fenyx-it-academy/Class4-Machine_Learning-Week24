We will use the dataset linked atÂ https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package. 

After performing all data processing and cleaning steps, and after splitting train /test.
* Logistic regression
* Naive Bayes
* K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
* Support Vector Mechanism (SVM)
Get predictions using Machine Learning models and compare these scores. 

Which of these models is the best?

Note: You should delivery your homework on Github. You can upload the Kaggle link upon Github by doing public. 

### Success!
